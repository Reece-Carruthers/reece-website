                <p>I am currently in my final year of University, studying Computer Science at Northumbria University, while I am working part-time as a Scala software engineer at HM Revenue & Customs.</p>
                <p>I would describe myself as a person with a strong work ethic who takes pride in their work and has strong critical thinking skills, which helps me to solve problems. I would also consider myself to be a happy and approachable individual who is easy-going, but serious when the time calls for it.</p>
                <p>I have a particular interest in Java, Scala and React</p>
